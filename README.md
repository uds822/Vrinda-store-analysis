# Vrinda-Store-Analysis

## Project Objective
This project analyzes the Vrinda Store's sales data for the year 2022 to create an insightful annual report. The goal is to understand customer demographics, sales trends, and order behavior to guide Vrinda Store's marketing strategies for 2023.

We analyzed the data using Microsoft Excel. The data was cleaned and validated before creating pivot tables to answer key questions about sales, orders, customer demographics, and product popularity. The insights gained from these pivot tables were consolidated into an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the data further using slicers.
